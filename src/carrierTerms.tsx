necessary equipment and qualified personnel for completion of the transportation services required for BROKER

consignee or receiver, at destination without diminishing or affecting CARRIER'S liability in the event of a

claimed and a material breach of this Agreement.

days advance written notice of cancellation or termination, and unless otherwise agreed, subject to the following
